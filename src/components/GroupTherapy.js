              I facilitate a stress management group based on the three pronged approach to self care: the <b>cognitive</b> approach, <b>relaxation</b> skills, and <b>expression</b> of positive into your life and negative out of your life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Utilizing the three pronged approach in the group you will learn to cope with challenges, manage your feelings, as well as make life goals. The groupâ€™s  support and encouragement will help you achieve them as well.
